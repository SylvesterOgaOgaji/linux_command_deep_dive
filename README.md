# linux_command_deep_dive: Terminal Command Explanations
This project is a hands-on guide to Linux command-line basics, designed to help users master essential terminal operations through practical examples and real-world scenarios. It focuses on foundational skills for navigating the Linux file system, managing files/directories, and understanding system configurations.

## 1. Confirming AWS terminal Connection
![Terminal Connection](./img/1.%20open%20terminal%20and%20connet.png)  
**Commands:**
```bash
pwd
ls -l
```
### Output:

pwd shows current directory: /home/ubuntu

ls -l lists directory contents (empty here).

Explanation:
Verifies the user is in their home directory and checks for files/folders.

## 2. Creating a Directory in a Restricted Location
![Permission Error](./img/2.%20error%20bc%20no%20sodu.png)
**Commands:**
```bash
mkdir /root/example        # Fails
sudo mkdir /root/example   # Succeeds
```

### Output:

Permission denied without sudo.

Success with sudo.

Explanation:
/root is accessible only to the superuser. sudo grants temporary root privileges to execute the command.

## 3. Successfully Created using Sudo
![Sudo Usage](./img/3.%20sudo%20is%20added.png)
**Commands:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /root/example   # Typo (invalid command)
```

### Output:
No explicit error shown, but the command sudo_mkdir is incorrect.

Explanation:
Typo in command: sudo_mkdir should be sudo mkdir. The correct syntax is sudo [command].

## 4. Creating Directory
![Folders in Photos](./img/3.%20three%20folders%20created%20inside%20photos.png)

```

### Output:
Folders admire, love, and pictures (with a nested structure) are created.

Explanation:

mkdir creates multiple directories.

-p flag creates parent directories if they donâ€™t exist.

ls -L lists directory contents (equivalent to ls -l here).

## 5. Finding Path of current working directory
Current Directory!

![Directory Navigation](./img/14.%20changing%20directory.png)
**Command:**
```bash
sudo cd /usr        # Fails (invalid syntax)
cd /usr             # Succeeds
```
## Output:

- sudo cd fails because cd is a shell built-in command.

- cd /usr works normally.

Explanation:

- sudo cannot execute cd directly; use sudo -i for a root shell instead.

- User navigates to /usr without sudo.

## 15. create dir photos inside /usr
![Photos Directory Creation](./img/15.%20create%20dir%20photos.png)

Explanation:

- mv moves files (deletes the original).

- Use mv -i for confirmation before overwriting.

## 26. Deleting a file  in a directory
![Remove File](./img/26%20file%20rm.png)  
**Command:**
```bash
rm demofile.txt
```
## Output:
demofile.txt is deleted from ~/Documents.

Explanation:

- rm permanently deletes files (no trash/recycle bin).

- Use cautiously; deleted files cannot be easily recovered.

## 27. Prompts system confirmation before deleting a file 
![Interactive Removal](./img/27%20removed%20file%20with%20dash%20i.png)
**Command:**
```bash
rm -i demofile1.txt
```
### Output:
Prompts: rm: remove regular file 'demofile1.txt'? y

Explanation:

- -i (interactive) asks for confirmation before deletion.

- Safe for preventing accidental file removal.

## 28. Removed without confirmation
![Force Removal](./img/28.%20Removed%20without%20confirmation.png)
**Command:**
```bash
rm -f demofile1.txt
```

### Output:
File demofile2.txt is deleted without prompts.

Explanation:

- -f (force) ignores nonexistent files and overrides confirmation.

- Warning: Can lead to irreversible data loss.

## 29. Removed a file recursively
![Recursive Deletion](./img/29.%20removed%20recursively.png)
**Command:**
```bash
rm -r demofile3.txt
```
### Output:
File demofile3.txt is deleted (though -r is unnecessary for single files).

Explanation:

- -r (recursive) is typically used for directories.

- Misusing -r on files works but is redundant.

## 30. Create a html file
![Create HTML File](./img/30.%20create%20a%20html%20file.png)
